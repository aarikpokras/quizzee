# quizzee
A bad alternative to quizlet.<br />
Quizlet made me get Quizlet Plus, so I made this.

## How to use
Just run the program with `sh main.sh`. It'll look for a file named `quizzee.dst` in a specific format.

### Shuffling terms
Run the program with the `--shuffle` flag.

## Dataset format
The dataset should be in the following format:
```
term : definition
```
Here's an example:
```
Water : H2O
Sweatshirt : Blue
Computer : Mac
```
